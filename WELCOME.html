<b>sfxPackager</b> is a light-weight, self-extracting install creation
utility for Windows that falls somewhere between PackageForTheWeb and NSIS,
functionality-wise.
By combining a user-friendly, drag-and-drop GUI with an integrated JavaScript
interpreter, you can quickly create attractive, fully-featured installers.
